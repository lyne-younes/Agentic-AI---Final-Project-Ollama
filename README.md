# Agentic Study Assistant

A multi-agent study assistant (university assignment): course materials, RAG-grounded Q&A, quizzes, flashcards, summaries, and Google Calendar–aware study planning.

## What you need

- **Docker Desktop**, installed and running.
- **[Ollama](https://ollama.com/download)**, installed and running. Every AI model runs locally in Ollama, so there are no AI API keys. The app downloads the models it needs by itself on first start (about 6 GB, once).
- **A Google account**, used both to sign in to the app and for the Google Calendar that the Study Planner reads and writes.

## How Google Calendar is connected

The Study Planner reaches Google Calendar through a **Calendar MCP server**. That server is part of this project (the `calendar-mcp` container) and starts automatically with `docker compose up`, so there is nothing to install for it. What it does need is a Google Cloud project where the **Google Calendar API is enabled**, plus an **OAuth client** so students can sign in with Google and grant Calendar access. Step 1 below sets both up. It takes about 10 minutes and is done once.

## Running it

### 1. Set up Google Cloud (one-time)

Google renames menus from time to time. If a link below doesn't land on the right page, use the search bar at the top of the console and search for the page name given in **bold**.

**1.1 Create a project**
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate and sign in with your Google account.
2. **Project name:** `Study Assistant` (any name works).
3. Click **Create**, wait a few seconds, then make sure the new project is selected in the project picker at the top-left of the page.

**1.2 Enable the Google Calendar API**
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/calendar-json.googleapis.com
   (or: menu ☰ → **APIs & Services** → **Library** → search `Google Calendar API` → click it).
2. Click **Enable**. The page then shows "API enabled".

**1.3 Configure the OAuth consent screen**

This is what students see when they click "Sign in with Google".
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/overview
   (or: menu ☰ → **APIs & Services** → **OAuth consent screen**; newer consoles call it **Google Auth Platform**).
2. Click **Get started** and fill in:
   - **App name:** `Study Assistant`
   - **User support email:** your email
   - Click **Next**. For **Audience**, choose **External**, then **Next**.
   - **Contact information:** your email, then **Next**.
   - Tick the Google API Services user data policy checkbox, click **Continue**, then **Create**.

   Click **Update**, then **Save**.
4. **Add test users.** Go to **Audience** (https://console.cloud.google.com/auth/audience). Leave **Publishing status** as **Testing**. Under **Test users**, click **Add users**, enter the Gmail address of **every account that will sign in** , and click **Save**. Only these accounts can sign in while the app is in Testing. This is also what lets university Google Workspace accounts sign in.

**1.4 Create the OAuth client (the credentials)**
1. Open https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
   (or: menu ☰ → **APIs & Services** → **Credentials**).
2. Click **+ Create credentials** → **OAuth client ID**.
3. **Application type:** `Web application`. **Name:** `Study Assistant web` (any name works).
4. Under **Authorized JavaScript origins**, click **+ Add URI** and enter:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```
5. Under **Authorized redirect URIs**, click **+ Add URI** and enter exactly this: `http`, not `https`, no trailing slash.
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback
   ```
6. Click **Create**. A dialog shows the **Client ID** and **Client secret**. **Copy both now** (or click **Download JSON**). Newer consoles show the secret only once; if you lose it, open the client and click **Add secret** to make a new one.

### 2. Configure the app

1. In the project folder, copy `.env.example` to a new file named `.env`:
   ```
   cp .env.example .env          # macOS / Linux / Git Bash
   copy .env.example .env        # Windows Command Prompt / PowerShell
   ```
2. Open `.env` and fill in:
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=` → the Client ID from step 1.4 (it ends in `.apps.googleusercontent.com`)
   - `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=` → the Client secret from step 1.4 (it starts with `GOCSPX-`)
   - `SECRET_KEY=` → any long random string. To generate one, run:
     ```
     python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(48))"
     ```

   Leave everything else as it is. The chat model defaults to `qwen3:8b` (about 5 GB; needs roughly 8 GB of RAM or VRAM). You can change it with `CHAT_MODEL` to any Ollama model with tool calling, e.g. `qwen3:14b` or `gpt-oss:20b` on a machine with about 16 GB. Embeddings use `qwen3-embedding:0.6b`.

### 3. Start

1. Make sure Docker Desktop and Ollama are both running.
2. In the project folder, run:
   ```
   docker compose up --build
   ```
3. Open http://localhost:3000 and click **Sign in with Google**. Use an account you added as a test user in step 1.3.
   - Google shows **"Google hasn't verified this app"**. This is expected for an app in Testing: click **Continue**.
   - On the permissions screen, **tick the Google Calendar boxes**. Without Calendar access the app sends you back to the login page with an explanation, because the Study Planner depends on it.

On the first start the backend downloads both AI models into Ollama (several GB, once; watch the progress with `docker compose logs -f backend`). Until they're downloaded, the chat replies that the models are still downloading, and uploaded materials wait in "indexing".
